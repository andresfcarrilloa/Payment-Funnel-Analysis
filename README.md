💡 # Insights:

🚫 Error vs. Success: Users often drop out at the stages marked as "User Error with Payment Submission" 🚫 and "Payment Processing Error with Vendor" 🛠️. These points in the payment process appear to be common stumbling blocks where users face difficulties or give up.

📈 Progress Tracking and User Experience: To enhance the user experience during the payment process, focus on improving the stages where users commonly encounter errors, such as "User Error with Payment Submission" and "Payment Processing Error with Vendor." Provide clearer instructions, better error handling, and user support to ensure a smoother payment journey. Additionally, consider evaluating and optimizing the stages where users drop out to reduce abandonment rates and increase overall success. 🛒💡
